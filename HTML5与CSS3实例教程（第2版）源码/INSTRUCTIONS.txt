# Sample code for "HTML5 and CSS3 - Second Edition"

This is the example source code for the book. It includes a Node.JS based
web server which you can use to run the code in your web browser.

You're encouraged to use the folder template/ as your starting point for your
own projects.

Configuring and Running the server
----------
The simple web server needs Node.JS and NPM installed in order to run. You'll
need to use Node.JS 0.10.0 or higher in order for things to work properly. 

Once Node is installed, configure the server from the Terminal like this: 

$ npm install

This will read through the `package.json` file and install the dependencies
for the server.

Once things are installed, run the server like this:

$ node server


License
--------

The web server is under the MIT license.
